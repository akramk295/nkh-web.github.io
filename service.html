                    NHK Technologies has been in business since 2010 as a Block-Time IT company that specialized in
                    break-fix services. NHK has had great success in servicing and maintaining small and medium size
                    companies by going beyond the normal scope of service. That fact still holds true and by conducting
                    thorough surveys and questionnaires, we have formulated an All-Inclusive IT Support model called
                    “NHK Total Care”. <br><br>

                    Whether you are the CFO looking to maintain business functions at a reduced cost or an IT Director
                    trying to manage a staff, unique situations can occur. The NHK Total Care solution is tailored for
                    the specific need of the business. We strategically developed a solution for businesses with an IT
                    staff or without an IT staff.<br><br>

                    The NHK Total Care solution was generated to eliminate the annoyances business owners, C-Level
                    executives, and IT Directors were experiencing. The NHK Total Care Solution is based around a Fixed
                    Fee model and disposes of any open ended costs associated with 3rd party IT support. Business
                    owners, CFO’s, and Controllers can accurately budget around their current IT network support without
                    any additional costs.<br><br>

                    One of the biggest challenges a business faces is the security of their network. Whether it is
                    protecting their client’s information, detecting and spoiling would- be hackers or keeping up to
                    date on new virus threats. The list goes on and on. NHK Total Care takes security to the next level
                    by utilizing enterprise equipment combined with the best pro-active measures, terminating any
                    security threats that will arise.<br><br>

                    As businesses rely more on data communication, it is essential to have a fully functional email
                    system, free of unwanted advertisements. The NHK Total Care Solution is provisioned with the world’s
                    leading security applications to guard against unwanted solicitations.<br><br>

                    NHK Technologies believes an effective consultant not only provides results-driven conclusions but
                    provides a detailed flow chart on how each solution was determined. The NHK Total Care Solution is
                    comprised of 4 areas of professional services. Each area is critical to ensure a healthy and
                    efficient IT infrastructure. The 4 areas of professional services are, but not limited to: <br><br>

                    NHK Technologies has been in business since 2010 as a Block-Time IT company that specialized in
                    break-fix services. NHK has had great success in servicing and maintaining small and medium size
                    companies by going beyond the normal scope of service. That fact still holds true and by conducting
                    thorough surveys and questionnaires, we have formulated an All-Inclusive IT Support model called
                    “NHK Total Care”. <br><br>

                    Whether you are the CFO looking to maintain business functions at a reduced cost or an IT Director
                    trying to manage a staff, unique situations can occur. The NHK Total Care solution is tailored for
                    the specific need of the business. We strategically developed a solution for businesses with an IT
                    staff or without an IT staff.<br><br>

                    The NHK Total Care solution was generated to eliminate the annoyances business owners, C-Level
                    executives, and IT Directors were experiencing. The NHK Total Care Solution is based around a Fixed
                    Fee model and disposes of any open ended costs associated with 3rd party IT support. Business
                    owners, CFO’s, and Controllers can accurately budget around their current IT network support without
                    any additional costs.<br><br>

                    One of the biggest challenges a business faces is the security of their network. Whether it is
                    protecting their client’s information, detecting and spoiling would- be hackers or keeping up to
                    date on new virus threats. The list goes on and on. NHK Total Care takes security to the next level
                    by utilizing enterprise equipment combined with the best pro-active measures, terminating any
                    security threats that will arise.<br><br>

                    As businesses rely more on data communication, it is essential to have a fully functional email
                    system, free of unwanted advertisements. The NHK Total Care Solution is provisioned with the world’s
                    leading security applications to guard against unwanted solicitations.<br><br>

                    NHK Technologies believes an effective consultant not only provides results-driven conclusions but
                    provides a detailed flow chart on how each solution was determined. The NHK Total Care Solution is
                    comprised of 4 areas of professional services. Each area is critical to ensure a healthy and
                    efficient IT infrastructure. The 4 areas of professional services are, but not limited to: <br><br>
